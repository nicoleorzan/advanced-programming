## Python interface

Write a Python interface to the binary tree you implemented in c++, such that you can construct, traverse and print the tree from a python program.

You are free to adopt the strategy and design you prefer for the interface.

### What you have to submit

- You have to upload only and all the **source files** you wrote (eiter c++ or python), with a
**Makefile** (or **CMakeLists.txt**) and a **readme.md** file where you describe how to compile, run your code and a short report on what you have done and understood.
